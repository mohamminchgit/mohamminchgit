### Hey, I'm Mohammad Amin Cheraghian! 🚀 | Tech Explorer & AI Enthusiast

I’m not a programmer, but I bring ideas to life with the help of AI.

**🧠 What I’m into:**  
Learning by building. Whether it's a smart Telegram bot or a tool powered by AI, I love experimenting and turning sparks of curiosity into real things.

**🔍 Currently digging into:**  
Programming foundations, algorithms, and Python—AI is my co-pilot and I'm learning how to fly smarter, not just harder.

**🤝 Open to collaboration:**  
Got a wild or creative project idea? Especially something around bots or AI? Count me in. Let’s build something cool together.

**📬 Reach out:**  
I’m most active on Telegram — [@mohamminch](https://t.me/mohamminch). Drop a message, say hi, or pitch an idea!

**⚽ A bit more about me:**  
I’m a football fanatic, family means the world to me, and honestly... the sound of typing on a mechanical keyboard? Pure joy.  
Building with AI, learning by doing, and having fun along the way—that’s the vibe.
